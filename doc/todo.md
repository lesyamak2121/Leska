# Short-term

- Nothing at present

# Long-term

- Extend structs to support custom mathematics operations; for
  example, some boards might calculate +5V differently than others,
  depending upon the value of the resistor tied to that pin
- Replace the gigantic database of motherboards and output params with
  a text file, so that users can modify and change the output strings
  to whever they wish.  This would also decrease the program/binary
  size
- Get in contact with Tyan regarding the Thunder LE-T (S2518), which
  appears to use the Winbond W83782D, and see if they'll provide SMBus
  documentation (if it supports tie-ins).  Note: Tyan Support does not
  appear to provide information for EoL'd boards, as demonstrated in
  https://github.com/koitsu/bsdhwmon/issues/2#issuecomment-141079566
